Scharr-overlay
===============================================

This code uses OpenCL & the Vitis vision libraries to compute a scharr filter of an image and overlay it in colour over the original image on FPGA.

Written during XUP Summer School on FPGA programming.

Work in progress - currently runs successfully in software emulation but hangs in hardware. Likely due to lack of stream delays.
